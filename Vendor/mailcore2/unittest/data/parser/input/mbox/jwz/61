My guess would be that one of the implementations is not using the
canonical form for end-of-line in text/plain.  The newlines in a
quoted-printable should be interpreted as 0D 0A for the purpose of
computing MD5 (as for all other purposes).  I'll bet one or more of
the implementations is treating it as either just 0D or just 0A, so
you get a different MD5 value.

Here is the same file encoded twice: one in quoted-printable, another
in base64.  They have the same canonical form and thus the same MD5.
See whether they get the same MD5 on your system:
