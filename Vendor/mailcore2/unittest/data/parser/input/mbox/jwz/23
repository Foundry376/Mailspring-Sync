Here is some new information you may find interesting...

I am now a New Entrepreneur..

I recently became an Entrepreneur and thought you would like to 
hear my story.

Being retired, age 72, I was bored , and I wanted to contribute 
something to life.  I am a Ham Radio operator, but that wasn't
enough to keep me busy.  In addition, I needed more money.   I
have a Computer/Modem and was fascinated by its possibilities.
Then I heard about the Internet, the Information Superhighway.

I heard about a program that gives advice on how to become 
an entrepreneur using the Internet.  I bought that program and 
started to use the Internet to market the same program I was
using. 

It proved to be quite successful.  I did not get rich, (yet) but
my time was very well utilized and I did make about $300 per week
after using the program for about a month.  More products are
being produced, and I fully  expect to be able to market these
products successfully.

It proves that one is never too old to become a successful
entrepreneur. I am very happy with my progress and will continue
to grow in this venture.

If  you want more information about this program, please contact
me at:
