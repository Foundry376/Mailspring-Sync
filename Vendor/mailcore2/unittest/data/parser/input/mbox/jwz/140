Subject: test of URLs in text/plain messages

We search through text/plain messages for URLs and make them clickable.
Here are some examples.

These should all have links over them:

	http://home.netscape.com and http://home.netscape.com/, (and the
	comma shouldn't be in the URL) "http://home.netscape.com:80/" 
	and <https://home.netscape.com> and mailto:jwz as well as
	mailto:jwz%2Cterry, and mailto:jwz,terry, but note that the final
	commas shouldn't be in the URLs.

	http://host/some-random-image.map?300,200 should have both numbers
	inside the link, and http://host/some-random.cgi?3,2,1, should
	have all three numbers in the link, but not the trailing comma.
	gopher://host/ blah blah blah.  But http://host,other-junk should
	stop before the comma, not include other junk in the URL.
	news:some.group should work.

These should NOT have links over them:

	mailto: shouldn't, since that's useless, as is news:, nor should
	about: since that's a word that occurs at the end of a sentence a 
	lot.  http: all by itself shouldn't have a link, neither should 
	gopher:, and "internal-gopher-binary" is a hackish internal image.
	news:a shouldn't either, because it's short.
	internal-external-reconnect sure shouldn't.

Ok!  That should cover it.
