The normal key-length recommendation was 96 bits.  64 bits and 80 bits are
equivalent to 512 bits and 768 bits respectively.  I would guess that a
1024-bit key is about as strong as an 96-bit key.  The first two numbers are
from _Applied Cryptography_; my estimate is an extrapolation from the data =
in
AC.
