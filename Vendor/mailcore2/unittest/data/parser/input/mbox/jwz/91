So far, I've managed to build all of the images for the new metamail rele=
ase.
I've come across the following:
<nl><indent>For SysVr3.2, the manifest constant R_OK is defined in <lt>sy=
s/unistd.h>. =

This change is in metamail/mailto.c.
<nl><nl>

In <bold>ezview/ezview.c</bold>, the <bold>#include <lt>file.h></bold> mu=
st follow the <bold>#include <lt>sys/types.h></bold>
in the <bold>#ifdef SYSV</bold> section, so I moved it to below the <bold=
>#endif</bold> for that bit.
<nl><nl>

For ISC SysVr3.2, the routine <italic>gethostname()</italic> (required by=
 <bold>metamail/mailto.c</bold>) is in the
library <bold>/usr/lib/libinet.a</bold>.  I added a new variable to the r=
oot and subsidiary
Makefiles, <bold>LDLIBS</bold>, which trails the other files and librarie=
s on the cc command
lines that produce executables.
<nl></indent><nl><nl>

I will send you context diffs of my changes tonight.  This is my first tr=
y
of "mailto", so we'll see if it works.  (I think it may have one of those=

"missing TERMCAP entry" problems that richtext used to suffer from.)
<nl><nl>

Also, I believe that the copyright notice in some of the files (README)
is out of date.
<nl><nl>

I'd send you the diffs now, except that I don't have a cdiff program on
<bold>persoft.com
</bold>so I figure I'll send it from
<italic>gorgon.UUCP
</italic>where I've got GNU diff.
