Subject: [!] HTML directory

Hi folks,

Rolling stones gather no moss, and we had some moss growing in the /text
directory. Igor just created a new directory for BBEdit related files in
/text, and I've just created a new directory in /text for HTML-related
files. Since many people probably relate HTML to the Web, I've made a link
to /comm as well.

new: text/html/
new: text/HTML now points to text/html/
new: comm/html now points to text/html/
new: comm/HTML now points to text/html/

cheers ... -Adam

Subject: [!] Yep -- we're moving files again

Hi, again,

We decided that the HyperCard directory really belongs under Development as
it mostly contains external functions and procedures that may be accessed
>From within a development environment. The migration of card/ to dev/card/
will take a few days as it is a large directory.

old: card/ is moving to dev/card/
old: HyperCard will be removed
new: dev/card/
new: dev/HyperCard now points to dev/card/


Also, we are changing our policy about non-Macintosh periodicals: We will
only keep the latest issue, and these may be found in the info/nms/
directory. We have plans to incorporate more disk into the archive. At that
time, we will consider archiving back issues, as we have done until now.

Cheers, Igor

Subject: [*] CD Database (FileMaker Pro Database for Compact Discs)

The CD Catalog is a simple yet powerful database to catalog your Compact
Discs.
It was made with FileMaker Pro version 2.1, you need the program to use it.
Not only may you search and print lists of your CD collection; but you can
generate reports and lists for specific categories of CDs, such as only your
CDs that are Soundtracks or are longer than 65 minutes.

It includes:

- An easy method of entry. Including fields for Artist/Album/Record Label/
Catalog #/Year of Release/SPARS Code (AAD etc.)/Classification (Rock etc.)
/Song/Song Time and a Comments field.
- Several (6) predesigned printable layouts.
- A layout by song
- A report layout that gives you lots of detailed info about your CD's:
such as the average/minimum/ and maximum time/year/and number of songs as
well as lots of other useless information (There are about 65 summary fields)

Changes since 1.2
- Track numbers for each song! A number comes up whenever you enter a track.
  Track numbers are also added to many of the print layouts.
- Smart sorting. Now you can enter "The Who" in the artist field and when you
  click on sort by artist it will put "The Who" in the "W" section, not the "T"
  section. This also work with album titles.

Subject: [*] Digital Money Developer's Kit

Permission is granted to include in your CD-ROM. This file is for your
Development folder. Thank you.

AutoPay (tm) is a small module that software developers can integrate into
their programs. It allows computer users to pay for software electronically
by modem. If the user does not have a modem, AutoPay allows the user to pay
by phone, using a toll-free number, or by mail.

There are no up-front charges for using AutoPay in your software. Instead
Digital Money, Inc. charges a small fee for each transaction. You do not need
your own credit card merchant account. Digital Money, Inc. runs the 24-hour
dial-in network, the 24-hour voice operator lines, and a mail-processing
center for handling all customer payments.

This is a fully functional Developer's Kit, not a demo! It contains complete
documentation. If you are interested in the Windows version, please contact
Digital Money, Inc. at (415) 833-0200.

From: peterm@jolt.mpx.com.au (Peter Marks)
Subject: [*] DropURL 1.0; dispatches URLs to appropriate clients

DropURL lets you store your favorite URLs as little text files. They work
rather like aliases.

DropURL is a simple droplet application accepts a text file dropped on to
it and uses Internet Config to determine the helper application you have
set for each URL type.

It attempts to locate or launch the helper application and then sends it the
standard GURL AppleEvent containing the URL in the text file.

You can drop multiple files, but only the first line (up to the return) of
each one is processed. Therefore you can safely put notes in the lines
following
the URL line.

If you change the creator of the text file (a utility is included) to
'GURL' then opening the URL file will get the URL. Thus URLs can be added
to your Apple Menu for example.

Requires Internet Config and System 7.

Have fun.

HomeMaker is a HyperCard stack that prompts the user to fill in information
appropriate for a personal home page. It then adds html tags to the info
and produces a text file ready to be posted on a webserver.

What's new in this version? Netscape enhancements that don't affect
non-Netscape browsers:

1) Better layout. When viewed in Netscape, the user's picture is placed off
to the right which allows more text to appear on the first screen.
2) Variable text size. The first letter in each <H1> and <H2> heading is
made larger.
3) Colors. Users can choose a background color and text color. HomeMaker
calculates the necessary hexadecimal RGB triplet and plugs it into the
<BODY> tag.

Freeware.

					  The Netherlands, April 24, 1995.
Hello dear reader,

Today I distributed NET_Mac2.3.51.sea.hqx...

For those who don't know NET/Mac...   NET/Mac is the application that
supports TCP/IP over packet-radio, which means, that hamradio operators
can use NET/Mac for their wireless TCP/IP network...

In this version of NET/Mac I implemented the following:

- Allow variable length ping-packets
- Defaultbuttons are FAT buttons now
- Fix some typo's in the sourcecode
- Make sure expired smtp-timers restart at 0
- Minor mod for the 'rdate' command
- Minor mod to the 'ping' console output
- Mods to fix a mail-delivery problem
- Some mods for the new 'timer task'
- Try to execute 'perform' commands at hh:mm:00 exactly
- When sessions are open at Quit-time, ask Quit-permission

Subject: [*] Personal Log v2.0 beta 1 PPC

Personal Log allows you to keep a collection of notes in a single,
easy-to-use file.  You can password protect this file, search it's entries,
and even "speak" the entries (if you have Speech Manager" installed).
Unlike other "note taking" programs, Personal Log's interface is very
simple and easy to use, yet provides powerful and flexible note taking
services.

Personal Log v2.0 is a major improvement over all previous versions.  As
you can already see, one of the major changes is the ability to insert
objects, such as pictures, sounds, and file aliases, into a document.  This
new feature is provided by a new text engine called WASTE, which is made by
Marco Piovanelli.  Along with the ability to insert objects, this new text
engine allows you to edit text files that are larger than 32K,  a famous
limitation of Apple's SimpleText.  With all these new features in the text
engine, it may surprise you that text files created by WASTE are still
compatible with Apple's Text Edit text engine (and thus SimpleText and
previous versions of Personal Log), though Text Edit will not recognize any
inserted objects nor will it edit files greater than 32K in size.

Subject: [*] The Talking Multiples Teacher v1.2

 This program has resulted from the frustration of trying to tutor a
gifted second grader in the study of the multiplication tables using
traditional methods and software programs.  I noticed that kids innately
count the multiples on their hands and rely heavily on their audible
sensors.   I was inspired to believe that if kids received this type of
musical association in the learning process of the multiplication tables,
that they would learn them faster and have more enthusiasm about it.   The
"Talking Multiples Teacher" accomplishes exactly this.    It imitates the
rhyme or song / chant that kids naturally associate with the times tables.

Subject: (Q) Single Key for Spanish characters in MSWord 5.1

Is it possible to coerce MSWord into allowing me to define a single key
shortcut, e.g., F5, <ctrl>a, or <cmd><opt>a to produce the a with the
accent above it which is normally produced with the two character
sequence "<opt>e" followed by "a"?  Not surprisingly, I wish to do
this for a, e, i, o, u, and I want the corresponding shortcuts for n
with tilde above and for the inverted ! and ?.

I played around a bit with Glossary entries which seems to be the sum
total of the "macro" capability.  I tried many approaches, but totally
failed to figure out how to make a glossary entry (like the default
ones for day and date) that would insert in the current font/style (at
the insert point) instead of the font it was created with.  The
default glossary entries are an existence proof that this can be
done; what is the trick?

Assuming the above can be solved, I know I can put a glossary entry on
the "Work" menu, and I know I can assign shortcuts to "commands" that
don't have them.  Can I assign a shortcut to one of these glossary
items on the Work Menu?

I tried a simple KeyQuencer macro (my first attempt at using
KeyQuencer) to see if that would provide a solution.  I simply hooked
up a shortcut key to send the decimal equivalent of the key I wanted.
This works EVERYWHERE but MSWord.

I have heard repeatedly that MicroSoft always does things differently,
so nothing standard ever works the way you would expect.  These
character codes (and probably all codes above 127) cause MSWord to
beep and ignore them UNLESS you have the "insert symbol" dialogue
active in which case they work perfectly.  I could not convince
KeyQuencer to send the two key-board events (in the X-windows sense of
key events) that actually form the character; it won't send <opt>e to
the program; only the "e" shows up.  I can easily imagine the reasons
why this doesn't work.

I bet that I can get KeyQuencer to cause MSWord to use a glossary
entry.  But for that to be useful, I still have to determine how to
get the "use glossary entry" to insert the characters in the
font/styles that are current at the insertion point.

By the way, with no fiddling around whatsoever, ClarisWorks did this
fine with their Macro capability.

Thanks for any help you can offer.

I know most of this is a crock because I read of people using these sorts
of connections all the time, here in the Digest. So what do you actual

The dial-up port offers speeds up to 28800 baud and V.34. My new Supra

The archive is compressed twice, for some reason.  But don't worry,
it will expand fine.  :)

(By the way, I am sure that the author has released it in a Compact Pro
sea, but, it now seems that (almost) all of the recent uploads to the
info-mac archives are automatically re-compressed into StuffIt archives...
I wonder why.)


Joe Holly continues:

I guess he means that Eagle loses its icon after he Rebuilds the Desktop.
This is normal.  Eagle is an 'appe', a background-only application that
is launched _before_ Finder is launched, at startup.  That means, that
Eagle is already running ('file busy'), when Finder rebuilds the Desktop,
and thus Finder fails to get the icon information from the 'Eagle' file.

A simple workaround:   Boot 'Extensions Off' whenever you Rebuild the
Desktop!   (Boot the machine with the Shift key pressed, and as soon as

By doing this, you will guarantee yourself a trip to the repair shop in the
not-too-distant future. Strain is put on parts of the tray that will
eventually break, resulting in a tray that doesn't retract all the way, and
requiring a replacement of the tray. When I worked in an audio repair shop,
there were two types of cd player problems - dirty lenses and broken trays.

Oh yeah, use the open/close button on your audio cd player at home, too. At
least they're put in a better location than the Apple ones.

At the risk of sounding like a flame (which is not what I intend), you must
have a somewhat different 300i Plus than I. Mine requires a _firm_ push
before it moves (yes, I just tried it). It also is rather wobbly, making it
difficult to push it _straight_ in.

I don't think this needs to be argued further. I just thought people should
be aware of the possible problems with this method of closing the CD tray.
That accomplished, I feel any further discussion should be taken to private
email. Anyone else interested can mail me too.

Like Dirk Thompson originally requested, I would much prefer a software
solution. It shouldn't be hard - if you can software eject, you should be
able to software inject.

I have a 500 MB internal Apple HD that I cannot access, mount, test,
initialize or even format!!  It was formatted (and partioned) with FWB 5
months ago, and last week I tried the newest Apple HD SC program (7.3.2) to
TEST the drive - not update it nor initialize or format it.  In the middle of
the test my system (7.5.1) crashed, and I did a hard reboot.  Since then I
cannot access the drive - FWB or other SCSI software cannot get any info off
the drive except the name (Seagate) and the Model number (3600N).  These
programs cannot mount the drive, update drivers, replace drivers, initialize
the drive or even reformat it!!!  A local computer repair center examined the
drive and does NOT think it is a logic board problem, but that maybe my
"Master Boot Record" is damaged.  Although the data on the drive has some
value (but is not worth $2000 to recover it), I really want to be able to
reformat the drive.  Does anyone know of a program that could FORCE write a
driver onto the disk (also, where on the disk the driver is usually written)
so I could at least mount the drive and recover some of the data or reformat
the entire disk.  Please help, and send any requests for additional info to
IceDoc@aol.com.  Please also email any responses if possible to me since my
access the the InfoMac Digest is difficult.

Performa 6115CD (6100/60) with and without the Apple Menu options

I DO NOT have any of the "Recent ..." options checked, and absolutely
agree that this option almost certainly causes all opens to go through
addtional overhead.  I cannot come up with an equivalent obvious
reason why there should be runtime overhead from the hierarchical menu
options when you do not allow it to keep track of recent files.  Can
anyone more familiar with the internals of the MacOS suggest why this
might cause degraded performance?

I would hate to see people throw out the good parts with the bad just
because we failed to identify and isolate the real cause of the
slowdown.

In the mean time I personally am going to take Pascal's well
intentioned advice and check out menuchoice to see if I think it does
a better job and incurs less overhead.

This is the question : should the mac users blindly trust a system
extension is reliable because it comes with the official Apple label? I
think we must stop to do it, especially with sys 7.5 and newer. In other
words, I strongly believe AMO belongs to the bad ones. There are others :
SCSI manager 4.3, general control panel, stickies (but who cares about this
one)...
More details in <http://www.macintouch.com/‾ricford/>

Overall performance is quite difficult to handle, and the speed
improvements I noted without AMO may be not objective. But I spent already
too much time (monthes) trying to make the system work without crashing,
I'm not ready to spend hours with a stopwatch to get an analysis which may
not be reproducible elsewhere. On the other hand, if you want to do it, I
am interested in your results.

The reason why I advised to kill AMO is mainly safety. If you didn't have
any crash scrolling down the apple menu, menus shifting off the menu bar,
and your disks spinning madly each time you unmount a volume, you're
luckier than I was.

By the way, does anybody know what's the use for the options of the

Michael,

I got MacLink Plus 8 bundled with Apple's System 7.5 on CD. Included was a
registration card and an offer to order a printed manual for US$ 10 + s/h,
total cost was approx. US$ 15 until it arrived here in Switzerland.

Probably, MacLink Plus is also available separately, but I think it might
be cheaper just to get it bundled with System 7.5.

Best wishes, Christian.

Is there a newer version of MacTCP Tool?  Could I be experiencing some other

Subject: System 7.5.x Rant

I just read Joe Holly's post and couldn't agree more.

<snip>
After having just caught up on six weeks of Info-Macs and other
readings, it sounds like System 7.5.1 is just not much better than that which
it purports to replace. I think I may wait until the next one (MF II).
<snip>

I tried 7.5 and hated life.  I was thinking of giving 7.5.1 a try until
I heard about an easter egg 7.5 involving a breakout game hidden in the
OS that displays the developers names.  Nice to know they have time to write
cute little code that does nothing but no time to port more of the MacOS
to powerPC native. It really makes me want to hold my head up high and say
"It's been over a year and my OS is still not native - but it will be
Real Soon Now."  I expect that kind of lag time with Microsoft (Win96 comming
Real Soon Now), but I would have thought Apple to be more concerned -
especialy since the clones are in the game now.  If PowerPC and Macintosh are
the way of the future then why isn't Apple running at full tilt to get
everyone there.  Just one more thing that makes it harder and harder to
defend Apple from the criticism of the pro-Windozw crowd.

My rant is now finshed and I yield the soapbox.

Subject: What's wrong with System 7.5 Update ?

I have tried to install the System 7.5 Update on my Centris 650, but
without success. Installation itself is no problem, but when I restart,
everything hangs.

Here's what I've done in more detail:

- Copied the working 7.5 system software (International English version)
to my second harddisk

- Selected the external disk in the "startup device" control panel

- Installed the update to the external disk

- hit the "Restart" button

... the system comes up (with the new logo, all extensions are loading),
alerts me that my last shutdown wasn't as expected - and hangs. A
"pumping, empty dialog box" appears.

- Restarted again with the external disk switched off (so that the Mac
uses the internal drive for startup)

- Mounted the external drive, deleted the system folder on the external
drive, installed clean 7.5 from the CD

- did a new update

- Restarted - same result as above.

Thus my question:
- What's wrong with the Update, or
- What's wrong with my Computer

Any hints welcome.

Greetings, Christian.
