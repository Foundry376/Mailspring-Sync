I have been reading the archived discussions and saw a lot of activity
around Dec 1994 about starting a newsletter, posting area and club shows,
even a judged show of trees!

Has there been any progress on any of these subjects?

With all the current traffic of people traveling and requesting information
for certain dates, there is an obvious need for posting club shows. The FAQs
might need updating to list area vendors.

Also, has there been any progress on the listings of clubs?
