 Nathaniel, 
<nl>

<nl>
I think the biggest problem with point size in the mail I sent you earlier was my own
<nl>
misinterpretation of the rtf  "fs" command.  It was not documented in my (sparse)
<nl>
RTF documentation but I guessed from context that it was point size.  I've done more
<nl>
experimenting since then and concluded that it is consistently twice point size.  So
<nl>
instead of a mixture of 12 to 24 point my previous message to you was 24 to 48 point.
<nl>
I didn't see it here because I either read it with metamail and no font software, or looped
<nl>
it back and read it on the NeXT where everything reversed itself.
<nl>

<nl>
It should be fixed here:
<nl>
	This is 12 point.
<nl>
	
<bigger>
 This is 14 point.
<nl>
	
<bigger>
 This is 16 point.
<nl>

<nl>

</bigger></bigger>
 This is back to 12 point.
<nl>

<nl>
I do have some followup questions.  Can I close a "bigger" environment with a "smaller"
<nl>
and vice-versa?  I was  doing that but for safety's sake I now use, e.g. "/smaller" when
<nl>
growing and the current point size is less than 10, but "bigger" when growing and the
<nl>
current point size is 10 or greater.  Is this necessary?
<nl>

<nl>
I also have a question about external-body messages.  If I have a multipart message it
<nl>
would be nice to make the first external-body segment  ftp, with parameters that would
<nl>
cause it to essentially mget all the files, so later segments could be local-file.  To do that
<nl>
I really want the first ftp call to mget all the files, create a subdirectory on the user's host,
<nl>
and put the files into the subdirectory.  One way to do that would be to make the NAME
<nl>
on the ftp access type the basename of the directory containing the message and make
<nl>
the MODE "directory" or "recursive" or some such.  But it needs to be something well
<nl>
defined for all the MIME readers.  Any thoughts on this?
<nl>

<nl>
Finally, I'm pursuing the problem where WIN/3b munched my Content-type line.
<nl>
I t's Wollongong rather tha attmail, but I haven't heard back yet from Wollongong.
<nl>
A "content-length" caption was added in as the content-type line was mangled,
<nl>
so I suspect WIN/3b sendmail has its own private interpretation of content-type.
<nl>
Until then I've shortened my boundary down to 5 lower case characters so this
<nl>
message shouldn't cause the trouble the last one did.
<nl>

<nl>
Thanks for your help,
<nl>
Marty
