I am sending this message to a few people who have established 
themselves, in the past, as relatively friendly consumers of 
experimental multimedia mail.  What I'd like to ascertain is how 
well this latest type of installed mail works in a variety of 
mail reading environments.

I expect that, in any event, you will have no trouble reading 
the English part of this message.  The more interesting question 
is how things like the next line will look to you:

!=ED=E5=EC=F9

If you're running X11 and things are working right, that should 
have been the Hebrew word "Shalom".   Please let me know if 
that's not what it looked like to you.  (Non-hebrew readers, please 
give me your best guess as to whether or not what you saw 
was Hebrew characters!)

Just for completeness, here's the Hebrew alphabet:

=E0=E1=E2=E3=E4=E5=E6=E7=E8=E9=EA=EB=EC=ED=EE=EF=F0=F1=F2=F3=F4=F5=F6=F7=F8=
=F9

Unfortunately, composing =E7=E9=F8=E1=F2 is still a serious nuisance, 
with no good software support at all for the composer, but receipt is 
always the first step in these things, which are best taken one step 
at a time.      !=E8=E0=EC, =E8=E0=EC
