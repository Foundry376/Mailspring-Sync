Skydiving, fun. Jumping free or attached to instructors?  If you don't
make it back I'll make sure the wake kicks butt.

I'm going deep sea fishing this weekend and will be up north next week for
some meetings and will stay the weekend to play with you kids... Excited
about a play from Chicago thats in SF now, Coed Prision Sluts, courtesy of
the Annoyance Theater. (www.annoyance.com)

Too bad the SMTP agent doesn't cover all the bases. I have to find someway
to get these NT users into line or disallow NT on the net.
