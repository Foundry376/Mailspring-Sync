Oh! (or Øh!) :-)

No. I wasn't even aware that sendmail did not take care of the actual delivery!

I am no Unix wizard, and just took over the responsibility for this system
from a guy who wasn't exactly a wizard either. Apparently I have been
completely off track; however it is amazing that you are the first to
point that out. Others have lead me into the wilderness, saying for
example that it is a problem with my SMTP client.

When I asked about this in comp.unix.aux last year (we were using 5.65
back then), Jim Jagielski told me:

We have been running A/UX sendmail almost straight out of the box here. So
when Apple released 8.6.9, we thought everything would be fine. Apparently
Apple delivers something that is not exactly in a working condition, now
why didn't we expect that?

That will be it!

I cannot thank you enough for being so crystal clear about this!

This followup is cross-posted to comp.unix.aux, as there are probably more
A/UX systems running straight out of the box with this problem waiting to
strike without warning.
