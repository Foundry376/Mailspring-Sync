Do you have any idea why relative links in mail documents
are not working?  Notice that they all resolve to:
file:#target instead of mailbox:message#target.

I can look into it but I thought you might know why
offhand.

I'm seeing the problem in akbar.

The Netscape juggernaut rolls on. Users now have access to groupware
features like Internet telephony, a "whiteboard" that enables users to view
and edit graphic images in real-time, an integrated VRML viewer, and
built-in audio and video viewers (fewer separate plug-ins for this).
Developers get something called LiveConnect, which lets them script and
link all sorts of live content (Java, plug-ins), more Java features, and
(surprise, surprise) new HTML tags. Administrators get a set of tools to
help configure Netscape across networks. The built-in View Source is
pretty, too. Take a look at the press release for more details. Download:

We could say this is the mother of all mother sites, but we won't. The
Family Planet Mother's Day Gateway lets you tell all about the best, worst,
and funniest things your mother has ever done. Even better, read the
contributions of others. If you're irresponsible and haven't yet bought a
Mother's Day card, the Gateway supplies free e-cards. There's even a
section where moms list their desired gifts. If you are a mom yourself,
there are a few relevant columns and a section devoted to the mommy wars -
working moms versus stay-at-homes. Come now, can't we all play nice?

MapQuest is one of the coolest applications to hit the Web. Surprisingly,
it is also one of the most useful. Pick a place - any place. Well, make it
an American place. Type the address into MapQuest and it returns a complete
graphical full-color map that marks your requested location. Use the
buttons to zoom in or out through levels of magnification from national to
a local street map. If you're traveling afar, you can even get driving
directions. For extra pleasure, check out the mega-cool Java and ActiveX
versions of the Atlas. This is a free service but registering lets you save
maps on file and store your map-viewing preferences. Plus, they gave us a
hat at Spring Internet World last week. <A HREF="http://www.mapquest.com/">"http://www.mapquest.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">POP ALT.CULTURE ON THE WEB</A></B>
<P>
This site promotes itself as "a swimming pool among the wading pools on the
Web" and it's not too far off the mark. Alt.culture, the Net version of the
book touted as an encyclopedia of '90s youth culture, is virtually drowning
in information. The hottest thing about this page is the Auto-Pilot, which
lets you get blip-verts of any of the 900+ articles. We shot through an
in-depth analysis of the voguing phenomenum, the V-chip, and biocular
dysphobia (VR-related health problem). Worth slipping into your floaties
and taking a dip. <A HREF="http://www.altculture.com/">"http://www.altculture.com/"</A>

A cross between celebrity worship and a venue for counter-cultural
information, Tim Leary's home page is literally a photographic tour of his
home. Travel into different rooms for glimpses of the art gallery, photo
archives, and library (featuring an HTML version of "The Psychedelic
Experience"). Much of the site is incomplete but the established framework
is clever and surprisingly slick for a site of this nature. Tim, as many
are aware, is slowly dying of cancer. You'll find health updates here along
with precise counts of his pharmaceutical (legal and illegal) intake.
Search deeper for the Leary Biscuit recipe (Ritz crackers, brie,
marijuana...). Sort of a Nixon Library for the rest of us, this site may be
worth tracking if the content grows. <A HREF="http://www.leary.com/">"http://www.leary.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS6">SPRINKLE'S WRINKLE</A></B>
<P>
Annie Sprinkle - performance artist, photographer, sexual activist, former
porn actress - has a Web page that touts her very special brand of female
sexual celebration. Here you'll find helpful information on cervical
self-examination, some very specific massage techniques, and perhaps a few
new ideas about sex and sexuality. The highlight - or nadir, if you feel
that way - is a look at her cervix through a speculum.

Some of the wealthiest geeks on the Net have made millions off their
technopassion. Hence, Net Millionaires, where you can watch their net
worths rise and fall by the minute, based on current stock prices. This
site cleverly melds market quotes with stock records to provide the
relevant information. As you might guess, Netscape chairman Jim Clark is a
billionaire. Alan Meckler, of Mecklermedia fame, is only in the low eight
digits. Pity there's no privacy anymore.... By the way, investors may find
the too-brief "Historical Analysis" listing useful. All this site needs,
perhaps, is a chat room where you could trade tidbits with columnists
waiting for the rise or fall. <A HREF="http://www.pulver.com:80/million/">"http://www.pulver.com:80/million/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS8">GRAND SLAM BUS TOUR</A></B>
<P>
No, it's not KISS - it's das Bus and it's making a tour of every Denny's
known to mankind. Okay, maybe not EVERY Denny's, but a whole bunch of them,
anyway. Turning an early childhood love into an adult obsession, Jason
Pfaff keeps a running journal of his Denny's visits with the pertinant info
available such as what they ate, who accompanied them, and - most
importantly - what free stuff they got or stole and whether or not there
was the requisite Weird Al Yankovic look-alike employee. It's not Kerouac,
but what do you expect for $1.99?

<B><A NAME="SS9">RIGHT THIS WAY TO HOLLYWOOD AND VINE</A></B>
<P>
It's flashy! Splashy! And just a little bit trashy! Capitol Records invites
you to visit "Hollywood and Vine", an impressive corner of the WWW inspired
by the famous Tinseltown intersection, which also happens to be in the
general vicinity of Capitol Records' headquarters. Ripe with funky,
postcard-like graphics, Hollywood and Vine is the ultimate tourist trap in
the realm of music and entertainment. Stop by the Leaning Tower Travel
Center for an overview. Check out upcoming music tour dates. Reminisce over
hits of the '70s. Send a friend a digital postcard. Bet you're wishing you
were here already. <A HREF="http://hollywoodandvine.com/">"http://hollywoodandvine.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS10">COMING ATTRACTIONS</A></B>
<P>
Most Hollywood studios have flashy presences on the Net. To keep up with
their new releases, you'd have to spend a lot of time surfing. Here's an
alternative that centralizes links to movie trailers all over the Web. It
ain't fancy but it's complete, with lists organized by studio. There are
also sections for foreign film studios, TV shows, and music videos. Even
before trailers become available, check out the upcoming movie list for
films in production or even pre-production stages. The "Hot Trailer Pick
Awards" highlights selected film sites of the week. You may be begging for
a cable modem after downloading some of the 6 MB whoppers. Curiosity has
its costs. <A HREF="http://lyre.mit.edu/‾deering/tpark.html">"http://lyre.mit.edu/‾deering/tpark.html"</A>

You probably already know about this movielicious site, but to compete with
commercial databases, the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), maintained by 18
people around the world, has established itself as a company - that is,
gone pro. Thank goodness its Web services will remain free, because the
database lists over 70,000 movies, including classics and current releases,
Hollywood and other films, along with biographies and background. If you
like, IMDb will notify you by e-mail of updates to this massive and
ever-growing resource. Every film student should link to it. US:

<B><A NAME="SS12">DAS PERSONAL UNDERSEA TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM</A></B>
<P>
Yearning for something other than the weekend yacht? US Submarines (USS)
offers several models of personal luxury submarines. The prices for such
goodies are steep, and even USS admits that the personal submarine concept
may seem a tad silly to the unenlightened. So, in addition to illustrations
and descriptions of the models, USS will also let you have $50,000 if you
happen to know anyone who can and eventually does purchase one of their
luxury subs. Start checking that address file. Credit USS for an
entertaining site and an idea that might shake a few cobwebs out of your
brain. After all, as the company says about its 188-foot, five-stateroom
Seattle 1000, "After one dive in Seattle, a simple megayacht will never
again suffice." That goes without saying. <A HREF="http://www.cnw.com/‾ussubs/">"http://www.cnw.com/‾ussubs/"</A>

newbie status and subject yourself to flames, spams, and fingers? If you
answered at least one yes and/or you don't have a clue as to what newbie,
flame, spam, or finger means, here's the perfect site for you. "Learn the
Net: the Essential Internet Online" guides you through Camp Internet.
You'll explore the mysteries of getting connected, memorize proper
netiquette, check out e-mail and newsgroups, and even learn how to create
your own home page. Yes, that is Larry Magid waving his little cyberhand.

<B><A NAME="SS14">YAHOOLIGANS</A></B>
<P>
Yahoo's site for 8 to 14-year-olds lives up to its devilishly clever name,
delivering links kids should find intriguing. Factor in Yahooligans'
rejection of sites that are "sleazy, slimy, snarly, paranoid, hateful,
hideous, harmful, pornographic or prejudiced" (there goes, what, a quarter
of the Web?) and you end up with a safe haven for junior surfers.
Otherwise, Yahooligans follows the lead of its older sibling, with new
sites, cool sites, and random sites just a click away, along with a helpful
breakdown of categories (check out Homework Answers in the School Bell
category). Club Yahooligans offers e-mail notices of cool sites, special
offers, and other nebulous coolness for anyone willing to fill out a form
apparently devised by someone from marketing. <A HREF="http://www.yahooligans.com/">"http://www.yahooligans.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT1">MUNICH FOUND</A></B>
<P>
Such is the name of a page we're glad we came upon. This Bavarian bounty
looks good and is bursting with high-quality content. Munich Found, the
cybercompanion to a paper edition, isn't just an online tourist pamphlet,
but is an intelligent look at the town and issues of import in Germany.
Articles in the April issue looked at the establishment of an urban car ban
to create a pedestrian zone, lingering effects of the Holocaust, and dating
in Germany. The latter warns that you could find yourself with "the well
mannered work horse who schedules spontanaeity in his Filofax." News
articles, a "what's on" list, and classifieds are typical for this kind of
page, but atypically interesting in style and perception.

Out West Online is the latest homespun spin on Out West Newspaper, the
9-year-old effort of Chuck and Rodica Woodbury on their journey down
western America's roads in a 24-foot motorhome/newsroom. This ongoing
quarterly travelogue of 100% bona fide American corn ranges across the
story of Hi Jolly and the US Camel Military Corps, to a garlic-loving ghost
in Bodie, Calif., and onto e-mail roadfood testimonials (including a hot
tip about the biscuits 'n' gravy at a diner in Dayton, Nev.), all peppered
with some genuinely useful info on various sites and activities west of the
Rockies. Check out the rocky mountain oyster "Testicle Festival" in Rock
Creek, Mont. virtually if you can't face it in the flesh.

just take a virtual tour, this site's 500 links cover everything Scottish.
Prospective tourists will appreciate the where-to-go, what-to-see, and
where-to-stay info, while those enamored of Scottish culture can delve into
the intricacies of clans and tartans, music and dance, Gaels and Celts, and
more. Also featured are links to Scottish business and economy, food and

Yet another ever-vigilant video camera is wired into the Web. This time,
instead of being in the bottom of a fish tank, it's at the bottom of the
planet - Mawson Station, Antarctica. Unfortunately, the sun does not appear
a whole lot these days, leading to crisp pictures of, well, not much. There
is a link to the midday picture, but truth be told, there's not that much
to see. For diversions the jaded or unadventurous might want to check
Mawson's weather and gloat that you're here and not there, and those in

You expect a lot from Ziff-Davis, and from the ZD Net Software Library you
get 10,000 points of light. The 1996 PC Magazine Shareware Awards Finalist
page is a gem in itself. "Editors' Picks", which includes thumbnail reviews
and ratings of current shareware, awards, and "Top Downloads", is a great
place to start. Internet and publishing tools, browsers, e-mail and news
readers, helper and communication apps, tutorials - ZD provides a treasure
trove for netters, newbies, Windows freaks, and Webaholics. What a gorgeous
triumph in design for Netscape users! What a joy to find so much useful
software in one place! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
