The Image button on the main interface, between Reload and Open, is for reloading images 
on the page you're viewing.  Sometimes Netscape Navigator incorrectly loads a file's 
images.  The Image button is for rectifying this problem.  Netscape Navigator has built in 
capabilities for viewing jpeg and gif files.  You don't need to configure a viewer for this.

There are hundreds of mpeg players on the Internet.   Which one you want is a matter of preference.  We have WHAM 1.31 on our page b=
ecause it's a widely used and accepted player.   For more players and info go to this URL:

http://www2.netscape.com/assist/helper_apps/index.html

No matter what player you choose, configuring them in Netscape Navigator is the same.  In the Options:Preferences:Helper Apps menu, =
you can tell Netscape Navigator what to do with certain files it downloads.   To play MGPEGs, set it like this:
MIME Type: video/mpeg
Application: Wham 1.31 (You can browse to make sure the path is right)
Action: Launch
Extension: mpeg, mpg, mpe

>>                  
Once again, which one you use is a matter of personal preference.  Both are well known and used applications on the Internet.  To ha=
ve Netscape Navigator use one of them, go to the Options:Preferences:Applications and Directories menu.  There you can set Netscape =
Navigator to use a Telnet application.  Simply use the browse option to specify the one you want to use.

Try

ftp://ftp.cica.indiana.edu 

If it's not there, do a search for the word Quicktime.  The configuration the same as for  a MPEG player.  

MIME Type: video/quicktime
Application: MoviePlayer (You can browse to make sure the path is right)
Action: Launch
Extension: qt
