       Title     : IP Broadcast over ATM Networks.                         
       Author(s) : T. Smith, G. Armitage
       Filename  : draft-smith-ipatm-bcast-00.txt

This memo describes how the IP multicast service being developed by the IP 
over ATM working group may be used to support IP broadcast transmission. 
The solution revolves around treating the broadcast problem as a special 
case of multicast, where every host in the subnet or cluster is a member of
the group.

Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-smith-ipatm-bcast-00.txt".
							
NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.
							
For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@cnri.reston.va.us.
							

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
