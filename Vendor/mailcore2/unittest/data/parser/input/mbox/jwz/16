I'm in my office now, so I can see the picture you sent me without
extreme slowness.  Very nice.  As for your questions:

The white space in your name was an accident on my part -- sorry about that.

The characters you didn't recognize -- in my From: field & my signature
-- are my name in Hebrew.  It's pronounced "Naftali Ben Shalom".

When you say that it isn't easy to do multilingual mail in MIME, I
presume what you mean is that it's a pain to have multiple parts, each
of them plain text in a different character set?  If that's what you
mean, I agree.  This will only be solved when the ISO 10646 and Unicode
folks finish their work and give us a "one-world" character set.  I look
forward to that day!  -- Nathaniel
