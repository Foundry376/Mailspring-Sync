Dear sasl ers

I got ERROR WRITING THE HOST SORT FILE, POSSIBLY OUT OF DISK SPACE

wner running a large data crunching job in batch mode, it goes automatically
 every morning and retrieves data fron RDB on 6.08 under VMS VAX.

I did check the disk space and actually the disk is full. So hat, well, it's an
 industrial plan vax and noone can touch the disk, if it's almost full, qwell,
 so be it. Then the question is :

is there a way to submit a sas job under vms from the system startup (located on
 the system disk) but redirecting ALL working areas on another disk ?

I tried all trivial solutions available under the system options of SAS, but it
 seems that SAS will always use some disk space on the system disk nevertheless.

Is there a safe way to run SAS on a vax with the system disk full ?

Thank you in advance.
