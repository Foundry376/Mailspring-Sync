 * File: exceptions.h
 * ------------------
 * This file contains a top-level exception handler to print exceptions thrown
 * by student code on the console.
 * It also contains some wizardry to try to retrieve a stack trace when the
 * exception is thrown, though it is hard to consistently do this on all platforms.
 * 
 * @author Marty Stepp
 * @version 2014/11/12
 * - made printStackTrace function publicly available
 * - added top-level signal handler (for null-pointer derefs etc.)
 * @since 2014/11/05
